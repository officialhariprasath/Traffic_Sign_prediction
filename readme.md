## Project Overview

The objective of this project is to build a CNN model that can classify images into various categories. The model architecture, training process, and evaluation metrics are detailed below.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of images categorized into different classes. Each image is labeled with the class it belongs to. The dataset is divided into training, validation, and test sets. 

### Data Preprocessing
- Images are resized to a uniform size.
- Data augmentation techniques are applied to enhance the diversity of the training set.

## Model Architecture

The CNN model consists of the following layers:
1. Convolutional Layers: These layers apply filters to the input image to extract features.
2. Pooling Layers: These layers reduce the spatial dimensions of the feature maps.
3. Fully Connected Layers: These layers perform classification based on the extracted features.

Here is a summary of the model architecture:

- Input Layer: Accepts images of shape (height, width, channels)
- Convolutional Layer: 32 filters, kernel size 3x3, ReLU activation
- Pooling Layer: Max pooling, pool size 2x2
- Convolutional Layer: 64 filters, kernel size 3x3, ReLU activation
- Pooling Layer: Max pooling, pool size 2x2
- Fully Connected Layer: 128 units, ReLU activation
- Output Layer: Softmax activation for classification

## Training

The model is trained using the following configuration:
- Optimizer: Adam
- Loss Function: Categorical Cross-Entropy
- Batch Size: 500
- Number of Epochs: 30

During training, the model's performance is monitored on the validation set, and dropout is used to prevent overfitting.

## Evaluation

The trained model is evaluated on the test set using the following metrics:
- Accuracy


Confusion matrices and classification reports are generated to provide detailed insights into the model's performance.

## Results

The results of the model are as follows:
- Training Accuracy: 98.4%
- Validation Accuracy: 91.3%
- Test Accuracy: 88.5%

Sample predictions and their corresponding true labels are visualized to showcase the model's classification capabilities.

## Dependencies

To run this project, the following dependencies are required:
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn


## Future Work

Possible improvements and extensions for this project include:
- Experimenting with different model architectures.
- Using transfer learning with pre-trained models.
- Hyperparameter tuning for better performance.
- Implementing a user interface for real-time image classification.
